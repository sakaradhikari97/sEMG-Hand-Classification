# Analyzing sEMG Signals for Hand Gesture Classification
## Abstract: Noninvasive surface electromyography (sEMG) is popular for measuring musculoskeletal activity. It is beneficial for long-term monitoring and rehabilitation due to its safety, reliability, and efficient capture of temporal signals. As a result, many researchers have shown interest in developing mathematical models to derive meaningful insights from minimal sensors. In this project, we explore the potential of ML and DL to identify pre-defined hand gestures from EMG data collected from seven sensors placed on the forearm. Traditional ML algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, LDA, KNN, SVM, and DL models such as MLP and CNN, were employed to investigate the effectiveness of each model. The study also examines hand classification from an image-based perspective due to the growth of AI and the ethical implications of using an individual's health data. Our results show that the KNN model achieved the highest accuracy of 81.42%, followed by SVM with 81.32% and the decision tree with 75.57% for a given combination of features. A three-layer MLP achieved an accuracy of 77%, and a CNN attained an accuracy of 99%. Our findings suggest that the ML models are highly accurate in predicting hand signs, but CNN requires higher data variability to avoid overfitting and address potential ethical considerations.
